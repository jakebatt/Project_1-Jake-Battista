 <h2>Tracer</h2>

 	<p>Tracer is my go to character. Her abilities include <i>Blink</i> which allows her teleport in the direction of the cursor, and <i>Recall</i> which allows her to teleport back to when <i>Blink</i> was used and also recalls her health. She is armed with two pulse pistols which fire 40 pulse rounds rappidly, her <strong>Ultimate - Pulse Bomb</strong> allows her to throw a large bomb that deals a lot of damage. She is an amazing offensive character due to her mobility and she is also a small target making her harder to hit. Downsides include low health, short range with pistols, and very hard to land the pulse bomb.</p>
 <h2>DoomFist</h2>

 	<p>DoomFist is a new character to the Overwatch game. He is the only melee offensive character, this allows him improved mobility and he is given slightly more health than other offensive characters. His abilities include the <i>Hand Cannon</i> which is a short range burst from his hand. Secondly is <i>Seismic Slam</i>, which DoomFist leaps forward and smashes into the ground causing enemies to be knocked back. <i>Rising Uppercut</i> is the third ability which allows him to punch enemies into the air this can also be combined with <i>Seismic Slam</i> to deal more damage. Lastly he has <i>Rocket Punch</i> which charges up and then DoomFist launches forward, this deals extra damage if enemies hit a wall. His <strong>Ultimate - Meteor Strike</strong> does loads of damage in close proximity when DoomFist leaps into the sky and comes crashing down. Downsides include short range, and long ability recharge times.</p>
 <h2>Soldier 76</h2>
 	<img src="dhttps://i.imgur.com/DmsGfz3.jpg" alt="Soldier 76" height="350" width="250">
 	<p>Soldier 76 was my first main and by far the easiest character to play in Overwatch, it is very similar to other shooters such as Call of Duty <strong>(YUCK)</strong>. Soldier is also an offensive character, and an asset to any team. He is armed with a pulse rifle which also has the ability to fire 3 <i>Helix Rockets</i>. Soldier also has amazing mobility because he is the only character in the game with the ability to <i>Sprint</i>. 76 is the biggest team player offensively due to the fact that he also has a <i>Biotic Field</i> which heals not only him but any other teamates in the vicinity. 76's <strong> Ultimate - Tactical Visor</strong> gives him the ability to lick on to enemy characters for a short period of time. Downsides include very limited damage dealing abilities, as well as very mediocre health and long recharge times.</p>
 <h2>JunkRat</h2>
 	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JsIu4F6.jpg" alt="JunkRat" height="300" width="300">
 	<p>JunkRat is a defensive character in Overwatch, I typically play either JunkRat, or Hanzo on defense, otherwise I flex based on the team composition. JunkRat is armed with a Frag Launcher which fires 5 grenades at a time they have incredible range. He also has the ability to place/throw not one but two <i>Concussion Mines</i> which cause the enemy to go flying while also dealing damage. JunkRat can also jump and blow up the mine to launch himself without taking any damage. His second abiltiy is the <i>Steel Trap</i> which clamps down on enemies immobilizing them and causing slight damage. Creating a trap with both abilities is super deadly and makes JunkRat one of the best defense characters strategically. His <strong> Ultimate - Rip-Tire</strong> is a motorized bomb that can roll across the battlefield it can climb walls and jump, you are given 10 seconds to detonate the bomb before it does so itself. Downsides include frag grenades delayed detonation, as well as the <strong>Rip-Tire</strong> being very easily destroyed by the enemy.</p>
 <h2>Reinhardt</h2>
 	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XvKj7WO.jpg" alt="Reinhardt" height="250" width="300">
 	<p>Reinhardt is what is known as part of the Tank class in Overwatch. He has 500 health and is an absolute beast. His Rocket Hammer is a super deadly hammer with a very good amount of range for a melee weapon. He also has some of the most useful abilities the first being the <i>Barrier Field</i> which is a large energy barrier that can absorb tons of damage before breaking, it is also large enough for most teamates to take cover behind. Reinhardt also has the ability <i>Charge</i> with this ability he charges in a straight line and can pin enemies and knock those around aside, most of the time when he pins an enemy they collide with a wall which causes tons of damage if not an elimination. Lastly he has the ability to <i>Fire Strike</i> which is when he whips his hammer forward causing a flaming projectile to be hurled at the enemy. His <strong>Ultimate - EarthShatter</strong> is a real game changer, he smashes his hammer into the ground which damages and stuns all enemies in its path which gives a short window for Reinhardt to wreak havok on the enemy team. Downsides include slow mobility, slow attack, and hard to aim the <i>Charge</i> ability.</p>
 <h2>Lucio</h2>
 	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/z1m0d6E.jpg" alt="Lucio" height="300" width="200">
 	<p>Lucio is somewhat of a last resort character for me. He is my go to Support hero for when everyone on the team decides that "Hey y'all we don't need a healer!" Newsflash you should always have a Support, no I don't care that it's Quick Play. Anyways, Lucio is actually pretty sweet, those who strictly main Lucio are flipping deadly so watch out. Lucio has heightened mobility with the ability to skate on walls, he is armed with a Sonic Amplifier which has two fire modes. The first being 3 shot burst of sonic projectiles, the second being a sonic blast which knocks enemies back as well as off the map (also commonly known as a "boop"). His abilities are also super helpful to the team, the first is <i>Crossfade</i> which gives Lucio the ability to switch between healing and speed boost for all teamates in his range. Secondly is <i>Amp It Up</i> which boosts the effects of whichever setting Lucio has his Crossfader to. His <strong>Ultimate - Sound Barrier</strong> is another game changer. It gives all nearby enemies an extremely large shield that lasts for a short period of time which allows them to really get into the action. Downsides include long recharge times, and deals very low amounts of damage.</p>
