  <h1>Some of My Favorite Music</h1>
  	<h2>STRFKR (Pronounced: star-fucker)</h2>
  		<p>STRFKR is a pretty odd band. They are a very mellow hipster group from Portland, Oregon (go figure) who have a sound that incorperates folk, soft rock, and vintage synthesizers to make for an enjoyable listen if you're just hanging out, or want something relaxing to listen to.</p>
  	<h2>Childish Gambino</h2>
  		<p>By far my all time favorite rapper. Childish Gambino has such a wide variety of experimental rap that he has made ranging from his first album "Royalty" which would be classified as <i>Soundcloud Rap</i>. "Camp" his second album was a bit more hardcore with breaks in between with very slow and melodic songs. His third album "Because of the Internet" is one of my most favorite albums of all time, I truly think this was the sound he was looking for all along. "Kauai" and "Awaken, My Love!" are his most recent. Kauai was more of a softcore rap on top of very bright tracks, its overall a very soothing album. Awaken, My Love! was by far his most experimental album I would describe it as beach funk, was not my favorite but still impressive none the less.</p>
  	<h2>Rush</h2>
  		<p>Rush is one of the top classical rock bands from the 70's in my opinon. The sheer amount of talent that the three members of the band has is absolutely incredible. Geddy Lee the lead singer had the ability to play bass guitar single handedly while also playing keyboard and singing. Neil Peart has the world record of the biggest drum set with a total of 52 different pieces, and yes every single one is used. Alex Lifeson the guitarist absolutely shreds on every single song. Together the trio literally kills every track and the album <strong> Rush 2112</strong> will take you on a rock and roll journey. </p>
  	<h2>David Bowie</h2>
  		<p>I personally think David Bowie is a little wacky which is one of the reasons I love him. His alter ego Ziggy Stardust absolutely rocks, and under his own name Bowie has released some fantastic dance tracks as well as many soft rock hits such as most of the album "Hunky Dory". He just has a phenomenal range of different songs that he has achieved over the entirety of his career which sadly ended with his death in 2016. Overall always a good listen, everyone should have a little Bowie in their life.</p>
  	<h2>Metallica</h2>
  		<p>METALLICA. I have been mindlessly head-banging to Metallica since the age of 4 thanks to my father. They were also my first concert that I went to in the fifth grade, it was life changing. Yes, Metallica is 110% <i>Dad Metal</i> but really who cares? "Ride the Lightning", "Master of Puppets", "...And Justice for All", and "Reload" are all fantastic albums. Not only are they fun, but after recently seeing them play Soldier Field this past summer and with every member approaching 55 years old in the next two years I can still say that, yes they still kick ass.</p>
  	<h2>Rage Against the Machine</h2>
  		<p>If you haven't listened to Rage Against the Machine yet, please do so but take precautions. This band has the power to start a full on revolution. I have never listened to a band before and immediately wanted to go fight someone. The bassist Tim Bob provides killer heavy basslines, Tom Morello who has been known to powertools on his guitar to achieve some unreal sounds is absolutley phenomenal (he was also the first boss battle in Guitar Hero 3 I believe), Brad Wilk on drums is a fantastic percussionist who always sets an upbeat tempo, and last but not least Zach de la Rocha the lead singer, the voice of an angry angsty generation is so flipping engergetic it gives me chills. With Rage Against the Machine being ranked 479th in the world by Spotify they're definitely worth a listen.  </p>
